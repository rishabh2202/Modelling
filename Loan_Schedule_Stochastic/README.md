# üè¢ Loan Schedule Stochastic Modeling for Real Estate Investment

This project models the financial performance of a real estate investment using Excel and Python (via `xlwings`). It simulates 1,000 scenarios to assess the risk and return profile of purchasing a commercial property, renting it out under a long-term lease, and selling it after 10 years.

## üìå Project Overview

- **Asset Type**: Commercial Property
- **Purchase Price**: ‚Çπ100 million
- **Lease Agreement**: 20-year lease with a large corporate tenant
- **Investment Horizon**: 10 years
- **Exit Strategy**: Sell the property after 10 years; lease continues with new investor
- **Funding Structure**:
  - 60% via bank loan (mortgage)
  - 40% via equity
  - Loan repaid fully upon sale

---

## üéØ Objective

To evaluate the investment's return profile by simulating:

- Annual rental income
- Loan amortization and interest payments
- Property value at exit (uncertain, modeled stochastically)
- Net proceeds from sale
- Overall return on equity (IRR, NPV, etc.)

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Excel Model**:
   - Loan amortization schedule
   - Rental income and cash flow tracking
   - Integration with Python via `xlwings`

2. **Python Simulation**:
   - Generate 1,000 scenarios for property value at year 10
   - Use probability distributions (e.g., lognormal or normal with drift) to model price evolution
   - Calculate equity returns for each scenario
   - Visualize distribution of outcomes (histograms, percentiles, etc.)

3. **Key Metrics**:
   - Investment Multiple
   - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
   - Shortfall Risk
